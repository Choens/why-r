                        <code>
              R is a programming language and software environment for
              statistical computing and graphics. The R language is
              widely used among statisticians and data miners for
              developing statistical software and data
              analysis. Polls, surveys of data miners, and studies of
              scholarly literature databases show that R's popularity
              has increased substantially in recent years.

                            This is not a WHY NOT SAS presentation. This is a Why R
                            presentation. By the end of the presentation, I hope to
                            have demonstrated that R is a relevant language in the
                            work we are doing today and will be even more relevant
                            in years to come.

                                Advance: The ecosystem of tools around R is nothing
                                short of AMAZING and it is getting more amazing every
                                single day, because ANYONE can contribute to the
                                ecosystem.

                                As of February 2, 2015: <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/">CRAN</a>,
                                the primary R repository, contains 6,391
                                packages. These are peer reviewed packages, developed
                                by the community. <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software">Bioconductor</a> contains
                                an additional 936 packages. Just let that sink in. And while you do:

                                I'd like to tell you about where you can use R. You
                                can use R from within SAS. You can use R from within
                                SPSS. You can use R from within MATLAB, Oracle,
                                Postgres, and Vertica. R skills are portable
                                skills. Microsoft recently bought the R-based
                                consulting firm Revolution Analytics, which could
                                result in better integration of R in Microsoft
                                produces such as SQL Server or even Office.
                            </li>  
                            <li>
                                Advance: This presentation isn't long enough to take a
                                deep dive into Literate Programming, but I do want to
                                mention this idea briefly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Literate programming is an idea from the 1980s, to
                                interweave natural language and computer programming
                                language. I'll give you concrete examples of this
                                later, but the upshot is that it makes it possible to
                                write a program that is both self-documenting AND is
                                able to compile to a finished, publishable manuscript
                                or report. No more cutting and pasting for an hour. No
                                more messing up a table because you forgot a decimal
                                point on the 9th row of the 3rd column. A
                                self-documenting, transparent manuscript that can be
                                published.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This is an idea from the 80s. The book, Literate
                                Programming was published in 1984. This is an idea
                                that is very influential in the R community and is not
                                only considered to be current and cutting edge, it is
                                something that people are working on today to make it
                                easier and faster to produce.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Advance: One good reason to use R is because it is
                                open source. Those 7,000+ packages? Only possible
                                because R is open source and engages with the
                                community.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                IBM is unlikely to make integrate SAS into SPSS. They
                                are competitors. Besides, owning SAS and SPSS on the
                                same machine without a student discout is
                                . . . prohibitively expensive. R is considered safe,
                                common ground, because it is not a commercial entity.

                                Advance: A perfectly reasonable, self-interested
                                reason to use any tool professionally is because you
                                think it will lead to future job opportunities.
                            </li>

                                Knowing how to use SAS effectively is a good way to
                                make yourself eligible for a large number of job
                                opportunities. Knowing how to use both R <emphasis>and</emphasis>
                                SAS effectively makes you relevant to even more future
                                job opportunities. Please note: I said AND. Not
                                or. Not instead of. I said AND.

                                all. There's too much out there and quite frankly, I
                                don't understand half of it.

                        The capabilities of R are extended through
                        user-created packages, which allow specialized
                        statistical techniques, graphical devices (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html">ggplot2</a>),
                        import/export capabilities, reporting tools

                        etc. These packages are developed primarily in
                        R, and sometimes in Java, C, C++ and Fortran.

                                personal use. Some are analyses. Some
                                are for various classes. The diversity

                                got a lot of the information I used in this
                                presentation. The amount of information there is
                                staggering and quite frankly somewhat obsessive.

                                R-Core is a powerful stats package. But I don't use
                                R because of the brilliance of R-Core. I use R
                                because of the packages.

                                In 2009 John Fox wrote some code that calculates the
                                number of R packages available on CRAN for each
                                release of R. This image does not include
                                Bioconductor or any other R package
                                repositories. Just the official CRAN packages.

                                model is a quadratic parabola. More importantly is
                                the continuing, rapid rise.

                                reasons to use R and one of the best reasons to run
                                for the hills. With this many options available,
                                there is duplication. Some packages are
                                brilliant. Some are bizarre. Some are probably
                                downright stupid. To leverage this incredible

                                of these packages do. Yes. There is actually a

                                R bills itself as the lingua franca of
                                statistics. This is done for several
                                reasons.

                                It is fun to say lingua franca. Admit
                                it. You're rolling your eyes, but you
                                know I'm right.

                                More importantly, providers of

                                support it. You can use R from within
                                SAS, SPSS, Oracle and Vertica. In
                                fact, it is actually difficult to find
                                a statistics package, database or
                                business intelligence tool that
                                doesn't support R.

                                in an office that uses SPSS, it is
                                possible to leverage R skills. If you
                                later move to a job that uses SAS,
                                your SPSS skills aren't very
                                useful. Your R skills . . . are. Sorry
                                for the pun. But I meant to do it.

                                come with a default interface of
                                questionable quality. And if you don't
                                like it . . . you can get over
                                it. There probably aren't very many
                                alternative choices.

                                R is different. In truth, the default
                                R interface makes the SAS interface
                                look positively utopic. But, because R
                                is open source and is the lingua
                                franca of the statistics community,
                                there are more interfaces available
                                for R than you have time to experiment
                                with. And more are coming out every

                              I should note, I learned about this
                              project only two days ago. If you
                              download or experiment with this
                              application, it may eat your computer.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              That said, this is an interesting effort
                              to take an interface, SPSS, familiar to
                              many social sciences students, and
                              reimplement a similar interface that
                              generates R syntax, rather than SPSS
                              syntax.

                              Will this succeed? I have no idea. But,
                              it gives you an idea of how R is seen as
                              the go-to language, the lingua franca,
                              of statistics.

                            From Wikipedia: The literate programming
                            paradigm, as conceived by Knuth,
                            represents a move away from writing
                            programs in the manner and order imposed
                            by the computer, and instead enables
                            programmers to develop programs in the
                            order demanded by the logic and flow of
                            their thoughts. Literate programs are
                            written as an uninterrupted exposition of
                            logic in an ordinary human language, much
                            like the text of an essay, in which macros
                            are included to hide abstractions and
                            traditional source code.

                            In other words . . . let's stop writing
                            reports and papers by running an analysis
                            and then cutting and pasting the results
                            into Word. This is an approach to science
                            that combines the writing and the
                            programming as a single, cohesive piece.

                            Literate Programming is a vast topic and
                            is worthy of multiple presentations in its
                            own right. Donald Knuth's ideas have had a
                            deep impact on how I prefer to approach
                            science. For the next few minutes, I would
                            like to show you some simple examples of
                            what literate programming means, to me.

                            literate programming. In the following
                            slides, we will look at some data, and
                            pictures. I didn't cut and paste this
                            information into this slide show. I
                            embedded it into the slide show. Let me
                            show you what I mean. But, to do that, I
                            need a data set.

                          Literate programming removes errors due to
                          cutting and pasting. The output is transparent

                        <li>
                          It is transparent, because you can look at
                          the data and look at the code and know where
                          the numbers come from. It is reproducible,
                          because I will get the exact same results
                          EVERY time I run this "report".

                          And if you give me a new data set (formatted
                          the same way), I can spit out a new, equally
                          accurate report in seconds. You cannot make
                          these claims when you assemble a report by hand.

                            <li>
                                The term open source means different things to
                                different people. In a nutshell, people interpret it
                                to mean 'free'.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                But it means much more than that. Open Source, or more
                                formally, Free and Open Source Software aka FOSS, is an
                                ideological method for the development, distribution
                                and use of software.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                But it is this ideology that drives so many of the
                                practical reasons people cite when choosing to use
                                R.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The ecosystem, the integration with other tools, the
                                veritable multitude of user interface options
                                available for R. . . . 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                All of this is made possible by the ideological
                                choices made by the R-Core team who lead the
                                development of R.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              The R ecosystem operates as a
                              meritocracy. Anyone can contribute. Your
                              ability to use the technology and to
                              contribute to its development is not
                              limited by the need to purchase an
                              expensive license. The SAS institute
                              could develop a SAS version of
                              SHINY. Maybe it already has. But SHINY
                              is free. SHINY can be used as easily by
                              someone in Mozambique as it can in New
                              York. And . . . . it is.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              I don't think R is competing with SAS
                              and SPSS because it is such a beautiful
                              language. It isn't. It is competing with
                              them because of the side affects of the
                              decision to develop R in an open,
                              inclusive and transparent
                              manner. Transparency, and a tradition of
                              sharing code results in better science.

                    <ol start ="0">
                        <li>
                            The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The freedom to study how the program works, and change
                            it to make it do what you wish.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your
                            neighbor.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The freedom to improve the program, and release your
                            improvements (and modified versions in general) to the
                            public, so that the whole community benefits.
                        </li>

                                lists the four freedoms associated with Free Software,
                                as defined by the Free Sotware Foundation as:
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Richard Stallman wrote these, thinking about
                                software. But, at the time her was working at the AI
                                lab at MIT, so science is not an unknown idea to him.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I believe these four freedoms fit in well with the
                                scientific process. Replace the word
                                program with analysis. And re-read it.
