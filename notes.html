    <h1> Why R</h1>
    <p>According
      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
    <code>
      R is a programming language and software environment for
      statistical computing and graphics. The R language is widely
      used among statisticians and data miners for developing
      statistical software and data analysis. Polls, surveys of data
      miners, and studies of scholarly literature databases show that
      R's popularity has increased substantially in recent years.
    </code>
    <p>
      This is not a WHY NOT SAS presentation. This is a Why R
      presentation. By the end of the presentation, I hope to
      have demonstrated that R is a relevant language in the
      work we are doing today and will be even more relevant
      in years to come.

    <h1>Bad Reasons To Learn / Use R</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Let's get this out of the way. There are
        several bad reasons to use any tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the context of today's discussion, I came
        up with the following bad reasons to use R.
      </li>
      <li>
        Advance: 3x
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Good Reasons to Learn / Use R</h2>
    <ul>              
      <li>
        Advance: The ecosystem of tools around R is nothing
        short of AMAZING and it is getting more amazing every
        single day, because ANYONE can contribute to the
        ecosystem.
      </li>
      <li>
        As of February 2, 2015: <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/">CRAN</a>,
        the primary R repository, contains 6,391
        packages. These are peer reviewed packages, developed
        by the community. <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software">Bioconductor</a> contains
        an additional 936 packages. Just let that sink in. And while you do:
      </li>
      <li>
        I'd like to tell you about where you can use R. You
        can use R from within SAS. You can use R from within
        SPSS. You can use R from within MATLAB, Oracle,
        Postgres, and Vertica. R skills are portable
        skills. Microsoft recently bought the R-based
        consulting firm Revolution Analytics, which could
        result in better integration of R in Microsoft
        produces such as SQL Server or even Office.
      </li>  
      <li>
        Advance: This presentation isn't long enough to take a
        deep dive into Literate Programming, but I do want to
        mention this idea briefly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Literate programming is an idea from the 1980s, to
        interweave natural language and computer programming
        language. I'll give you concrete examples of this
        later, but the upshot is that it makes it possible to
        write a program that is both self-documenting AND is
        able to compile to a finished, publishable manuscript
        or report. No more cutting and pasting for an hour. No
        more messing up a table because you forgot a decimal
        point on the 9th row of the 3rd column. A
        self-documenting, transparent manuscript that can be
        published.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is an idea from the 80s. The book, Literate
        Programming was published in 1984. This is an idea
        that is very influential in the R community and is not
        only considered to be current and cutting edge, it is
        something that people are working on today to make it
        easier and faster to produce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Advance: One good reason to use R is because it is
        open source. Those 7,000+ packages? Only possible
        because R is open source and engages with the
        community.
      </li>
      <li>
        IBM is unlikely to make integrate SAS into SPSS. They
        are competitors. Besides, owning SAS and SPSS on the
        same machine without a student discount is
        . . . prohibitively expensive. R is considered safe,
        common ground, because it is not a commercial entity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Advance: A perfectly reasonable, self-interested
        reason to use any tool professionally is because you
        think it will lead to future job opportunities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knowing how to use SAS effectively is a good way to
        make yourself eligible for a large number of job
        opportunities. Knowing how to use both R <emphasis>and</emphasis>
        SAS effectively makes you relevant to even more future
        job opportunities. Please note: I said AND. Not
        or. Not instead of. I said AND.
      </li>
      <li>
        Advance: But please. Don't take my word for it. See
        what some of these people have to say.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ecosystem</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The R ecosystem is vast. Because anyone can alter it,
        extend it or otherwise bend it to their will, they
        have.
      </li>
      <li>
        R is used for social science research, genetics,
        econometrics and betting on Football (both types).
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm going to give you a peek into this vast
        ecosystem. But all I can't even begin to explain it
        all. There's too much out there and quite frankly, I
        don't understand half of it.
      </li>
      <li>
        But don't worry. Neither will you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Packages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Anyone in this room can write and contribute a package. Anyone
        in Albany can write and contribute a package to the R
        ecosystem.
      </li>
      <li>
        If others value it, it will be used. It will get blogged
        about. Others will use it.
      </li>
      <li>
        To contribute a package, or to R-Core, you don't have to work
        in a specific office or have a specific title.
      </li>
      <li>
        R packages are like extensions for Firefox or Apps for Google
        Chrome. The take the base system and enhance it. And if you
        have ever looked at the number of extensions and apps for a
        web browser, it is staggering. Now, imagine that same
        diversity in an analytics package.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, stop imagining, because you can have it and it won't cost
        you a dime. (Please wait to then end to start downloading.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Popular Package Places</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> CRAN: The official R repositories. Wide ranging collection
        of packages. The growth of packages on this repo alone is
        staggering, and only increasing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bio: Provides packages for the analysis of genomic
        data. Bioconductor and R are the two repos I use the
        most. Packages here tend to be of very high quality, are
        updated, and well accepted by the broader community. There are
        over 7,000 packages at these two sites alone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Omegahat: Older repo. Predates CRAN. Has more bleeding edge
        packages. For example, there is a package to integrate R and
        Firefox, allowing you to run R within a webpage. Some
        duplication with CRAN.
      </li>
      <li>
        R-Forge: Clone of the venerable Source Forge site. This page
        is mostly packages not yet approved for distribution via CRAN,
        or is the beta version of the next release. Use most of this
        at your own risk. Some very interesting packages.
      </li>
      <li>
        GH: OMG. There are over 20,000 public repositories on GitHub,
        which appear to be R source code. Some of these are packages
        developed by the author for personal use. Some are
        analyses. Some are for various classes. The diversity here is
        incredible. I have no idea how to count only those repos on GH
        that are packages. I looked around, and nobody else does
        either.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>To Infinity & Beyond!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I want to plug the r4stats page, which is where I got a lot of
        the information I used in this presentation. The amount of
        information there is staggering and quite frankly somewhat
        obsessive.
      </li>
      <li> R-Core is a powerful stats package. But I don't use R
        because of the brilliance of R-Core. I use R because of the
        packages. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In 2009 John Fox wrote some code that calculates the number of
        R packages available on CRAN for each release of R. This image
        does not include Bioconductor or any other R package
        repositories. Just the official CRAN packages.
      </li>
      <li>
        For those keeping track at home, the super-imposed model is a
        quadratic parabola. More importantly is the continuing, rapid
        rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        This single image is quite possibly one of the best reasons to
        use R and one of the best reasons to run for the hills. With
        this many options available, there is duplication. Some
        packages are brilliant. Some are bizarre. Some are probably
        downright stupid. To leverage this incredible resource takes
        time and it takes expertise.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Packages Examples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Describe the packages.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Package Craziness</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I'm not even going to pretend like I know what some of these
        packages do. Yes. There is actually a package on CRAN
        dedicated to fisheries science. And, I genuinely have NO idea
        what the ChIPpeakAnno package does. But with over 7,000
        packages, even a social worker like me is bound to find
        something useful.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Commercial Support</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        R bills itself as the lingua franca of statistics. This is
        done for several reasons.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is fun to say lingua franca. Admit it. You're rolling your
        eyes, but you know I'm right.
      </li>
      <li>
        More importantly, providers of commercial products agree. You
        can use R from within SAS, SPSS, Oracle and Vertica. In fact,
        it is actually difficult to find a statistics package,
        database or business intelligence tool that doesn't support R.
      </li>
      <li>
        That means R skills are portable. Even in an office that uses
        SPSS, it is possible to leverage R skills. If you later move
        to a job that uses SAS, your SPSS skills aren't very
        useful. Your R skills . . . are. Sorry for the pun. But I
        meant to do it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interface Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Most commercial statistics packages come with a default
        interface of questionable quality. And if you don't like it
        . . . you can get over it. There probably aren't very many
        alternative choices.
      </li>
      <li>
        R is different. In truth, the default R interface makes the
        SAS interface look positively utopic. But, because R is open
        source and is the lingua franca of the statistics community,
        there are more interfaces available for R than you have time
        to experiment with. And more are coming out every day.
      </li>
      <li>
        I apologize for the color theme shown in all of the
        screenshots. I like it. It is called Solarized and is
        available in most pro-grade programming environments these
        days. I tend to use it anywhere / everywhere I can. Makes my
        eyes hurt less. All screenshots are taken from one of my
        laptops, and show a section of code I wrote in R and Emacs
        org-mode to assess a Kaggle data set about the Titanic
        disaster.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interface - RStudio</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        RStudio is becoming THE interface for R. It presents the user
        with an interface roughly modeled after matlab. It is easy to
        use, available on Windows, Mac and Linux and has an active
        user base. This the interface I recommend to people if they
        don't otherwise have an opinion.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interface - EMACS / ESS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ESS - Emacs Speaks Statistics. This is as bare bones as it
        gets. RStudio is an IDE. This is a text editor. In truth. It
        is THE text editor. All others are just playing catch-up. Fans
        of other text editors are welcome to email me to try to
        convince me otherwise.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interface - Eclipse / Statet</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Eclipse is a popular open-source Java IDE that is used by Java
        developers here at DOH. The plugin for R is called
        Statet. Eclipse has plugins that allow it to connect to
        databases such as Oracle and Vertica, write Java / C
        applications, program in R, SAS, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        If all you want is an interface for R, you are probably better
        off with RStudio. If you want a high-quality interface to
        nearly everything. Use Emacs or Eclipse.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interface - JASP</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I saw this project only two days ago. If you download or
        experiment with this application, it may eat your computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        That said, this is an interesting effort to take an interface,
        SPSS, familiar to many social sciences students, and
        re-implement a similar interface that generates R syntax,
        rather than SPSS syntax.
      </li>
      <li>
        Will this succeed? I have no idea. But, it gives you
        an idea of how R is seen as the go-to language, the
        lingua franca, of statistics.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interface - Custom Dashboard</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        But what if you want to deploy a custom
        interface? An interface to help an end-user
        understand a specific idea? What if you don't
        want to separate your code from your
        presentation?
      </li>
      <li>
        SHINY is here to help. This is an extension to
        R that allows you to build dashboards and
        complex analytic websites in R. We will
        explore this particular dashboard in more
        detail shortly.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want a modern, powerful interface, for
        programming, interactive research or
        presentation, R has an option that at the very
        least rivals anything else on the market.
      </li>
      <li>
        Total cost for the software seen in this
        presentation? Nothing. At its best, science is
        a meritocracy. R, and the dynamic ecosystem
        around it epitomizes this meritocratic spirit.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Literate Programming</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        From Wikipedia: The literate programming paradigm, as
        conceived by Knuth, represents a move away from
        writing programs in the manner and order imposed by
        the computer, and instead enables programmers to
        develop programs in the order demanded by the logic
        and flow of their thoughts. Literate programs are
        written as an uninterrupted exposition of logic in an
        ordinary human language, much like the text of an
        essay, in which macros are included to hide
        abstractions and traditional source code.
      </li>
      <li>
        In other words . . . stop writing reports and papers
        by running an analysis and then cutting and pasting
        the results into Word. This is an approach to science
        that combines the writing and the programming as a
        single, cohesive piece.
      </li>
      <li>
        Literate Programming is a vast topic and is worthy of
        multiple presentations in its own right. Donald
        Knuth's ideas have had a deep impact on how I prefer
        to approach science. For the next few minutes, I would
        like to show you some simple examples of what literate
        programming means, to me.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this point, it is worth pointing out, this
        presentation is an example of literate programming. In
        the following slides, we will look at some data, and
        pictures. I didn't cut and paste this information into
        this slide show. I embedded it into the slide
        show. Let me show you what I mean. But, to do that, I
        need a data set.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MTCARS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The MTCARS data set is commonly used in R examples when doing
        linear regressions. Since it works for everyone else, I
        decided to do it too.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MTCARS - Just A Glimpse</h2>

        We are going to focus on the mpg, cyl, and
        disp columns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Here, I am displaying the code used to
        produce the tabular display. As we will
        see, I don't have to do that. Sometimes it
        is beneficial to do so. Usually it is not.

    <h2> R Markdown</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can build a literate programming in HTML,
        Word, LaTeX, etc. And all of those languages
        and tools have their place. But right now I
        want to focus on something called R Markdown.

        How many of you have written a report, only to
        discover you made an error when cutting and pasting
        your results into Word? Literate programming removes
        errors due to cutting and pasting. The output is
        transparent and reproducible.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is transparent, because you can look at
        the data and look at the code and know where
        the numbers come from. It is reproducible,
        because I will get the exact same results
        EVERY time I run this "report".
      </li>
      <li>
        And if you give me a new data set (formatted
        the same way), I can spit out a new, equally
        accurate report in seconds. You cannot make
        these claims when you assemble a report by hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Science should be reproducible and verifiable.

    <h2>The Return of SHINY</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        R SHINY, the customizable interface for R is
        another, more complex form of literate programming.
      </li>
      <li>
        In this case, it is interactive.
      </li>
      <li>
        And that is awesome.

    <h2>Open Source /<br/> Open Science</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The term open source often seems to have a negative
        connotation in people's minds. That is unfortunate,
        because it is everywhere. The Internet, your cell
        phone, SAS. None of this would work without open
        source. I want to dispel some myths and show you that
        R's greatest strength is the open source license.
      </li>
      <li>
        In fact, R, without the open source license would be
        just another failed stats package. I'm standing here
        talking about R, the open source implementation of
        S. I doubt any of us will ever use S and nobody here
        cares. S doesn't matter. There is no community. There
        is no vibrant ecosystem. R matters, and it is the
        license that makes it different and better than its
        predecessor.
      </li>
      <li>
        People interpret Open Source to mean 'free'.
      </li>
      <li>
        But it means much more than that. Open Source, is an
        ideological method for the development, distribution
        and use of software.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ecosystem, the integration with other tools, the
        veritable multitude of user interface options
        available for R. . . .
      </li>
      <li>
        All of this is made possible by the ideological
        choices made by the R-Core team who lead the
        development of R.
      </li>
      <li>
        Science isn't about getting into a journal. Science is
        about understanding. Science is about
        collaborating. Darwin didn't pull evolution clean out
        of the sky. Evolution was part of a larger zeitgeist.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Darwin's day, journals were where that conversation
        happened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Today, the conversation is about data. The discovery
        of the Higgs Boson? Data driven. And you can download
        the code they used to do it. Obama Care? Data
        driven.
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to have a data driven conversation, we have to have a
        common language. Tools like R and Python are that common
        language, not because they are fundamentally better, but they
        are fundamentally available to anyone. With these tools, code,
        the true lingua franca of modern science, can be understood
        and used by anyone. From Mozambique to Albany, NY.
      </li>
      <li>
        R isn't competing with SAS and SPSS because it is a beautiful
        language. It isn't. It is competing with them because of the
        side affects of the decision to develop R in an open,
        inclusive and transparent manner. Transparency, and a
        tradition of sharing code results in better science.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Open Source Is Everywhere:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I want you to get one thing straight. Open Source
        isn't other. It is right in front of you. Have you
        used the Internet? Congrats. You are a user of open
        source. From databases to web-servers, open source
        powers the Internet. Not proprietary tools. This isn't
        other, it is mainstream.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Even @ DOH:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Surprise, many of the tools you use every day are
        either open source or are based, at least in part, on
        open source software.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discuss SAS / Vertica.

    <h1>Why?</h1>

    <h2> The Four Freedoms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">Wikipedia</a>,
        lists the four freedoms associated with Free Software,
        as defined by the Free Software Foundation as:
      </li>
      <li>
        Richard Stallman wrote these, thinking about
        software. But, at the time her was working at the AI
        lab at MIT, so science is not an unknown idea to him.
      </li>
      <li>
        I believe these four freedoms fit in well with the
        scientific process. Replace the word
        program with analysis. And re-read it.
      </li>
      <li>
        I just defined open science. A form of verifiable,
        transparent science that uses code as the common core
        language that can be used, modified, and critiqued by
        anyone.
      </li>
      <li>
        To the extent that science today is driven by data,
        the language of science must be code. We are all
        computer programmers because we are scientists and
        code is our common language.
      </li>
      <li>
        Therefore we should use a language, a code, that is
        available to anyone. Because science is about
        understanding and that fundamentally requires
        communications and collaboration.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real: Code, Science, People</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Now it gets personal.
      </li>
      <li>
        My wife is a Type 1 Diabetic. Managing diabetes is a
        full time job. Tools such as the Dexcom Continuous
        Glucose Monitor (CGM) are nothing short of
        revolutionary. This is device she wears, which can
        estimate her blood glucose level every 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before this, she could only know her blood glucose
        level when she manually tested her blood by pricking
        her finger. Obviously, she can't do this every 5
        minutes. She wouldn't have any fingers left.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Nighscout project is a open source data system
        that reads the data from the CGM and uploads it to a
        Mongo database, making the data accessible to anyone
        in the world. For parents of Type 1 children, this is
        revolutionary. Equally revolutionary, Type 1 diabetics
        can contribute their CGM readings to a centralized
        database. This is the single largest repository of CGM
        data in the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        But this data has a problem. Nobody has a good way to
        use it, to manage it, to analyze it. Yet. By the end
        of the year, there will be a package for R called
        Nightscout. It will be able to interface with a user's
        private data AND the central data warehouse. It will
        be able to return key statistics, such as an estimated
        A1C score, which is a key process measure for the
        management of diabetes.
      </li>
      <li>
        I know this, because I'm going to write it. Any
        doctor, or researcher will be able to use this package
        to download data from the Nightscout project,
        structure it and return some basic analyses of the
        data. Anyone studying diabetes will be able to take
        advantage of this technology. This is open
        science. Completely transparent. Completely
        reproducible. By anyone on earth.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Open Data or Open Science?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Cuomo administration has made great strides in
        publishing government data to the public.
      </li>
      <li>
        But data without code is fairly useless. True
        transparency comes from a combination of the two. Open
        science, transparent and reproducible, like what the
        Nightscout project is doing, enables citizens to
        understand its government.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many of these open data sets are anonymous versions
        of data sets used internally for measurement and
        evaluation. Citizens should have access to the code
        AND the data, because you need both to understand. And
        when a license to SAS and SPSS cost thousands of
        dollars, I argue that these tools are fundamentally
        inappropriate for this purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        As citizens we have a right to know what government is
        doing. Wrapping that understanding up in a tool that
        is inaccessible to all by the wealthiest does not lead
        to further citizen engagement.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Job Growth</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Everyone wants a job.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Jobs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        February 2014, relative distribution of what appear to
        be analysis related jobs on Indeed.com, which is
        really awesome in that it makes its data accessible to
        others through an API.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discuss Java, SAS, R, SPSS
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who Wants A Job?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Although SAS has more jobs posted on indeed.com, SAS
        isn't growing. R is. R is growing rapidly.
      </li>
      <li>
        This isn't an argument against SAS. SAS is still
        bigger than R. It is an argument that knowing both is
        a good thing.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Indeed.com Query</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The former pictures are links to the site on
        indeed.com's page where you can reproduce these
        pictures. The code on this page is the code I used to
        produce the pictures. Unfortunately, indeed.com is
        blocked here at DOH, so these are static images, not
        live returns from their website.
      </li>
      <li>
        But, here is the code I used. Feel free to reproduce
        it, improve it, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another plug for r4stats, where I got the idea for
        doing this. This is a modified version of what they
        publish. My modifications are an attempt to focus the
        query on health care, which is obviously more relevant
        for this audience.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Everyone Writes About R</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We are almost done here, but there is so much more I
        could say. Fortunately, I'll bow out and let others
        continue the conversation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lots of Articles About . . . . R!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        With the exception of the article by Revolution
        Analytics, all of these articles were in the
        mainstream press.
      </li>
      <li>
        I should point out that the NY Times publicly uses R,
        so their coverage could be a little biased. I don't
        know if Fast Company uses it internally or not.
      </li>
      <li>
        I included the white paper by Revolution Analytics,
        because it goes into a lot of great detail. I'm not
        saying this is an "article". This is an advocacy
        piece, written by some very smart people.
      </li>
      <li>
        And I'm apparently not the only one who thinks they
        are clever. Earlier this year, Microsoft bought
        Revolution Analytics because they felt they were left
        out of the ongoing revolution in data
        analytics. Although R has its roots and history in
        Unix, I am curious to see what Microsoft can do with
        this. Enhanced interoperability with Excel, SQL
        Server, Access, etc. would certainly be interesting.
