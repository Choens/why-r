# Abstract

From the
[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&)
to
[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/welcome.html?destination=https://www.fastcompany.com/3030063/why-the-r-programming-language-is-good-for-business),
the R programming language has received an abundance of positive media
coverage. In spite of all the hype, many researchers don’t know what
it is or why people are so interested in it. This presentation will
set aside the hype and focus on what R is and how it is fundamentally
reshaping research today.
 
R is an open-source programming language designed to make statistical
analysis easier. Unlike tools such as SAS or SPSS, R is not controlled
by a single company. Instead, R is a collaborative effort of
statisticians, programmers and researchers. As a result, R is not a
single tool or product line. It is an open ecosystem of inter-related
tools, products and community norms and practices. This openness and
freedom to innovate is fundamentally different than what is offered by
traditional analysis tools and it is changing the way research is
done.
 
The “Why R?” presentation will introduce participants to R’s ecosystem
and discuss how this ecosystem is affecting the development of new
research methods and practices. To highlight how R is altering
research practices, the presentation will introduce an idea called
literate programming which will allow the presenter and the
participants to collaboratively analyze, discuss and understand an
actual data set during the presentation. It will close with a brief
discussion of the rapid industry acceptance of R and what this means
for future job growth and careers.
 	 	
# About the Presentation

Why-R is a HTML presentation written in
[Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/), with some Literate
Programming elements (.Rhtml). The why-r.Rhtml is the primary file to
follow for explanations to the changes, although those changes will be
reflected in the final produce (why-r.html) once the presentation is
compiled.

For live demos, the Why R presentation also relies on a separate repo,
[why-r-shiny](https://github.com/Choens/why-r-shiny) which is a SIMPLE
shiny example I host
[shinyapps.io](https://choens.shinyapps.io/why-r-shiny).
