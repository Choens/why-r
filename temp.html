                There are packages there to help you connect to
                databases, draw maps, analyze surveys and generally do
                your work better.
              </li>
              <li>
                In many cases, there's nothing revolutionary in these
                packages. I contribute to a package called sqlutils,
                which is a collection of functions that simplify
                working with databases. There's nothing revolutionary
                in there. I know. I've read every line of code in the
                package. But, the sheer breadth of the collection,
                which is growing at an astounding pace, is what is
                amazing. All of these people, coming together to build
                something better. It is exactly the sort of analytical
                community I want to be a contributing, valued member
                of.

          The "Task Views" page (subject list) on the CRAN website[31] lists a
wide range of tasks (in fields such as Finance, Genetics, High
Performance Computing, Machine Learning, Medical Imaging, Social
Sciences and Spatial Statistics) to which R has been applied and for
which packages are available. R has also been identified by the FDA as
suitable for interpreting data from clinical research.[32]

Other R package resources include Crantastic, a community site for
rating and reviewing all CRAN packages, and R-Forge, a central
platform for the collaborative development of R packages, R-related
software, and projects. R-Forge also hosts many unpublished beta
packages, and development versions of CRAN packages.

The Bioconductor project provides R packages for the analysis of
          genomic dataxb
          , such as Affymetrix and cDNA microarray object-oriented
data-handling and analysis tools, and has started to provide tools for
analysis of data from next-generation high-throughput sequencing
methods.
